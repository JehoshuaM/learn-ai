## Key Characteristics  

- **Automation** – Machines perform tasks without continuous human guidance.  
- **Learning** – Ability to improve from experience and data.  
- **Adaptability** – Systems adjust to new inputs or environments.  
- **Decision-Making** – AI can analyze situations and select the best possible action.

## Types of AI  

- **Narrow AI (Weak AI)**  
  - AI specialized in a single task (e.g., image recognition, recommendation systems).  
- **General AI (Strong AI)**  
  - Hypothetical AI that can perform *any* intellectual task a human can.  
- **Superintelligent AI**  
  - A theoretical stage where AI surpasses human intelligence in all domains.

## AI vs Machine Learning  

- **Artificial Intelligence** is the broader concept of creating intelligent machines that can simulate human behavior and cognition.  
- **Machine Learning** is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling systems to learn from data and improve without explicit programming.

## Core Components of AI  

- **Knowledge Representation**  
  - How machines represent facts, rules, and relationships about the world.  
- **Reasoning**  
  - Drawing logical conclusions from available information.  
- **Learning**  
  - Improving system performance using experience/data.  
- **Perception**  
  - Interpreting sensory input (vision, speech, etc.).  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
  - Understanding and generating human language.  
- **Planning**  
  - Setting goals and creating sequences of actions to achieve them.
