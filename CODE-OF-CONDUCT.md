# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Sharing knowledge about Hugging Face models and AI/ML in a helpful and educational manner
* Providing accurate information about model capabilities, limitations, and appropriate use cases
* Respecting intellectual property and properly attributing model creators and researchers

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Sharing or promoting models that could be used for harmful purposes without proper warnings
* Misrepresenting model capabilities or performance metrics
* Submitting false or misleading information about models
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to contributions such as:
* Issues and pull requests
* Comments on model recommendations
* Discussions about model performance and capabilities
* Sharing of benchmarks and evaluation results

## Reporting and Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement by:
* Opening an issue in this repository (for non-sensitive matters)
* Contacting the maintainer directly through GitHub

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## AI and ML Specific Guidelines

Given the nature of this repository, we have additional guidelines specific to AI and machine learning:

### Responsible Model Sharing
* When contributing model recommendations, provide accurate descriptions of capabilities and limitations
* Include appropriate warnings for models that could be misused
* Respect the original creators' intended use cases and licensing terms
* Do not promote models designed for harmful applications

### Accuracy and Transparency
* Verify benchmark results and performance claims before sharing
* Clearly distinguish between official results and community evaluations
* Credit original researchers and cite appropriate papers
* Acknowledge when information is uncertain or disputed

### Inclusive AI Practices
* Be mindful of bias and fairness considerations in model recommendations
* Promote diverse perspectives in AI development and evaluation
* Support accessibility and multilingual capabilities where relevant
* Encourage responsible development and deployment practices
